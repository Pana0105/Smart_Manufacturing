Smart Manufacturing Dashboard

Welcome to the Smart Manufacturing Dashboard, a comprehensive web-based solution designed to optimize factory operations and provide real-time insights into machine performance. This project is built on the XAMPP stack with PHP for server-side scripting, and it uses a MySQL database to manage user roles and log data.


Features:

User Roles: Four distinct roles—Administrator, Factory Manager, Production Operator, and Auditor—each with specific access and permissions.

Dashboard Monitoring: 

Real-time monitoring of machines and factory performance with interactive visualizations.
CRUD Functionality: Create, read, update, and delete operations for machines, jobs, and roles, depending on user privileges.

Security: 

Input validation, and role-based access control.

Machine Logs: 

Historical data from factory-logs.csv is used to track machine performance, providing operators with critical insights into operational states.

Alerts & Notifications: 

Notifications for machine malfunctions or downtime.

Requirements:

PHP (server-side)
MySQL (database)
XAMPP (for local development)
No external libraries or frameworks (pure HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP)

How to Run:

Clone the repository.
Import the SQL file to set up the database.
Ensure your XAMPP server is running.
Navigate to localhost/index.php to begin.

This project is a prototype designed for Industry 4.0 smart manufacturing, offering real-time machine insights and operational control to enhance factory productivity.
